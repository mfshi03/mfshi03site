Recently, there has been news of an AI-Art generation tool called Midjourney that has already won an art competition. 

This incited me to find out more about this tool and see for myself what it could do. 

Here's what I Learned:

Midjourney is one of a few image-generation softwares that can be given a prompt to generate an image based on the key words in
the prompt. The difference between midjourney and these other softwares is that it is uniquely suited for artistic representations because of the
way it can use style with a machine learning technique called stable diffusion. This has attracted a large community of users who use this software to generate images by mastering the art of prompt creation.

But besides all this, the images that Midjourney creates are absolutely stunning. Here are some of the images I made with the software:

Î -model requests the network to run two passes per sample, doubling the computation cost. To reduce the cost, **Temporal Ensembling** ([Laine & Aila 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02242)) maintains an exponential moving average (EMA) of the model prediction in time per training sample $$\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i$$ as the learning target, which is only evaluated and updated once per epoch. Because the ensemble output $$\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i$$ is initialized to $$\mathbf{0}$$, it is normalized by $$(1-\alpha^t)$$ to correct this startup bias. Adam optimizer has such [bias correction](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/232741/why-is-it-important-to-include-a-bias-correction-term-for-the-adam-optimizer-for) terms for the same reason.
