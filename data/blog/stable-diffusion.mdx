Recently, there has been news of an AI-Art generation tool called Midjourney that has already won an art competition. 

This incited me to find out more about this tool and see for myself what it could do. 

Here's what I Learned:

Midjourney is one of a few image-generation softwares that can be given a prompt to generate an image based on the key words in
the prompt. The difference between midjourney and these other softwares is that it is uniquely suited for artistic representations because of the
way it can use style with a machine learning technique called stable diffusion. This has attracted a large community of users who use this software to generate images by mastering the art of prompt creation.

But besides all this, the images that Midjourney creates are absolutely stunning. Here are some of the images I made with the software:

### How it works?

What are diffusion models?
	Diffusion models are a form of generative models.  In the special case of generative models, we have two neural networks called the discriminator and generator networks. The generator network essentially learns to generates new data samples from the input data and the discriminator network learns to classify generated vs input data. Over iterations, the generator network is able learns how to generate more similar data to the input.


In stable diffusion, autoencoders are used to derive latent variables from the images. This autoencoder architecture is uniquely suited for this task because of it's ability to minimize the loss of information from the input data.
