### Introduction

Since December, I have been invested in learning and playing with ChatGPT, an OpenAI platform to generate text with a Large-Language model(LLM). Based on what I've seen so far,
these LLMs have a lot of potential to disrupt and generate industries with this technology.With this in mind, my first thought was the similarity between this UI platform
and gooogle in terms of its information retrieval ability for text. The major difference between the two is that ChatGPT only utilizes pre-trained data to generate answers.
As a result, it cannot access information on the internet. But what if it could?
