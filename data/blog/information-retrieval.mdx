### Introduction

Since December, I have been invested in learning and playing with ChatGPT, an OpenAI platform to generate text with a Large-Language model(LLM). Based on what I've seen so far,
these LLMs have a lot of potential to disrupt and generate industries.With this in mind, my first thought was the similarity between this UI platform
and google in terms of its information retrieval ability from text. The major difference between the two is that ChatGPT only utilizes pre-trained data to generate answers.
As a result, it cannot access information on the internet. But what if it could?

### Web-Crawling

In order to give GPT-3 the ability to browse the internet, the first problem I had resolve was transferring most information on the web into
readable text. For this problem, I stumbled on [DiffBot](https://app.diffbot.com/extract/) an API to help parse text from different types of websites such as article, discussion board, and video sites.
With this and the YouTube Transcripts API, I could now freely programmatically access most information on the web. The next problem I needed to solve was navigating the web and naturally I came across
[Google Custom Search](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/), a customizable search console and API for browsing the internet. With these two functionalities in hand, I could now query and
retrieve text information.

As a side note, I think developing this web crawling functionality was a good experience because with a few good google searches I was able to avoid
difficult technical hurdles altogether. It's always a good thing to check for pre-existing solutions especially in software engineering where it is heavily
emphasized to simplify problems. More on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIz7H5ruy0)

### Semantic Queries

I really do believe the intersection between search and Large-Language models will be an important breeding ground for revolutionary information technology.
I'm not sure if this the greatest way to describe this technology, but I like to think of theses LLMs as a universal query language because they demonstrate the ability to extract contextual meaning from
a huge set of information structures.

With this in mind, I set out to use ChatGPT to find use cases for improved search. The first one I thought about was using ChatGPT to generate
additional descriptors based on the keywords of the query to be appended to the search. This was a kind of simple first introduction to this. It turns out this
idea relate a lot to "query language" and the use of search specifiers that everyone is aware of such as "site:website", but no one actually considers to use on a consistent
basis.
