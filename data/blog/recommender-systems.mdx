Recently, I read a paper about YouTube selects content to be in your recommendation.

It essentially describes how user are clustered based on their interests in comparison to other people. If you are familiar with recommendation systems this know as collaborative filtering and is what most companies such YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook use to recommend content to you

Over the past couple of weeks, I haven't had the time to spend on any of these platforms. With this time away, I realized how important these recommender systems are in the context of how people interact with information. Think about it, for the first time in human history, people are finding their significant others using recommender systems on platforms such as Tinder.

The way Tinder works is that it embeds all information in your profile into a vector which maps to a latent space that represent the characteristics of all people
