Broad interests in software engineering, machine learning, math, and entrepreneurship.

I value learning from first principles and applying them to challenging problems. Grateful for the creative outlet programming gives me.

Graduated with my degree in CS from Virginia Tech in Spring 2024.

My favorite past times are building software, training models, playing basketball, and online chess.
