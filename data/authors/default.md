I have broad interests in software engineering, machine learning, math, and entrepreneurship.

I value learning from first principles and applying them to challenging problems. It's especially exciting for me to discover innovative solutions.

I graduated with my degree in CS from Virginia Tech in 2024.

My favorite past times are building software, training models, playing basketball, and online chess.
